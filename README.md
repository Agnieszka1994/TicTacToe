# Tic Tac Toe
Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. \

The credential must be provided following the below pattern: \
```
(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)
(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)
(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)
```
## Get started!
- Download the repository 
- run the program in the command-line
